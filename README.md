# Amazon reviews
### Meet our team and project
We are Martí Cortada, Marçal Estruch, Jofre Poch and Pol Rifé, four enthusiast students in the world of Data Science and Engineering. We have created **Amazon_reviews** public repository in order to be used as a common workspace for the development of a very interesting project.

As far as the project concerns, in a nutshell, we have decided to apply a LSTM architecture over the Amazon_reviews dataset (which consists, as the name specifies, of a great amount of reviews from Amazon) in order to perform a text classification task. You will be able to get further information in the _Dataset Card_ and _Model Cart_ in the `Docs` folder of our repository.
